/* Arrow functions */

const greet = function () {
	console.log("Hey")
}

/* Basic arrow function syntax with one argument and an expression in the body */

// 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between 
//    the argument and opening body bracket



// 2. Remove the body brackets and word "return" -- the return is implied.



// 3. Remove the argument parentheses



/* With one or more arguments we need to have parenthesis around arguments */



/* If the body requires additional lines of processing, 
   we need to add curly braces around function body and keyword return */



const products = [
  { name: "Clean Code", price: 33, currency: '$', almostSoldOut: true}
]


/* Use forEach method to alert the user for every item that is almost sold out*/


/* Use map method to make a new array where price and currency are in British pound */


/* Use filter method to make a new array which only has products,
    where price is less than 15 dollars
*/


/* Spread operator */

/* Make a copy of the products array, add another product */


/* Make a copy of the first product, change the name value */



/* Destructuring */

/* Save the first products name, price, currency and almostSoldOut into variables of the same name */


/* Make a copy of the first product, change the name value */
